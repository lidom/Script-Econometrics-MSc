<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Regression Models with Multiple Regressors</h1>
<p>In what follows we introduce linear regression models that use more than just one explanatory variable and discuss important key concepts in multiple regression. As we broaden our scope beyond the relationship of only two variables (the dependent variable and a single regressor) some potential new issues arise such as <em>multicollinearity</em> and <em>omitted variable bias</em> (OVB). In particular, this chapter deals with omitted variables and its implication for causal interpretation of OLS-estimated coefficients.</p>
<p>Naturally, we will discuss estimation of multiple regression models using <tt>R</tt>. We will also illustrate the importance of thoughtful usage of multiple regression models via simulation studies that demonstrate the consequences of using highly correlated regressors or misspecified models.</p>
<p>The packages <tt>AER</tt> <span class="citation">(Christian Kleiber &amp; Zeileis, <a href="#ref-R-AER">2017</a>)</span> and <tt>MASS</tt> <span class="citation">(Ripley, <a href="#ref-R-MASS">2018</a>)</span> are needed for reproducing the code presented in this chapter.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Omitted Variable Bias</h2>
<p>The previous analysis of the relationship between test score and class size discussed in Chapters <a href="lrwor.html#lrwor">4</a> and <a href="htaciitslrm.html#htaciitslrm">5</a> has a major flaw: we ignored other determinants of the dependent variable (test score) that correlate with the regressor (class size). Remember that influences on the dependent variable which are not captured by the model are collected in the error term, which we so far assumed to be uncorrelated with the regressor. However, this assumption is violated if we exclude determinants of the dependent variable which vary with the regressor. This might induce an estimation bias, i.e., the mean of the OLS estimator’s sampling distribution is no longer equals the true mean. In our example we therefore wrongly estimate the causal effect on test scores of a unit change in the student-teacher ratio, on average. This issue is called <em>omitted variable bias</em> (OVB) and is summarized by Key Concept 6.1.</p>
<div class="keyconcept">
<h3 class="right">
Key Concept 6.1
</h3>
<h3 class="left">
Omitted Variable Bias in Regression with a Single Regressor
</h3>
<p>Omitted variable bias is the bias in the OLS estimator that arises when the regressor, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, is <em>correlated</em> with an omitted variable. For omitted variable bias to occur, two conditions must be fulfilled:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is correlated with the omitted variable.</li>
<li>The omitted variable is a determinant of the dependent variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, 1. and 2. result in a violation of the first OLS assumption <span class="math inline">\(E(u_i\vert X_i) = 0\)</span>. Formally, the resulting bias can be expressed as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat\beta_1 \xrightarrow[]{p} \beta_1 + \rho_{Xu} \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_X}. \tag{6.1} \]</span> See Appendix 6.1 of the book for a detailed derivation. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.1">6.1</a>) states that OVB is a problem that cannot be solved by increasing the number of observations used to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, as <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> is inconsistent: OVB prevents the estimator from converging in probability to the true parameter value. Strength and direction of the bias are determined by <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Xu}\)</span>, the correlation between the error term and the regressor.</p>
</div>
<p>In the example of test score and class size, it is easy to come up with variables that may cause such a bias, if omitted from the model. As mentioned in the book, a highly relevant variable could be the percentage of English learners in the school district: it is plausible that the ability to speak, read and write English is an important factor for successful learning. Therefore, students that are still learning English are likely to perform worse in tests than native speakers. Also, it is conceivable that the share of English learning students is bigger in school districts where class sizes are relatively large: think of poor urban districts where a lot of immigrants live. <br></p>
<p>Let us think about a possible bias induced by omitting the share of English learning students (<span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span>) in view of (6.1). When the estimated regression model does not include <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> as a regressor although the true data generating process (DGP) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \beta_2 \times PctEL \tag{6.2}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(STR\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> are correlated, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rho_{STR,PctEL}\neq0.\]</span></p>
<p>Let us investigate this using <tt>R</tt>. After defining our variables we may compute the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(STR\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> as well as the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(STR\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(TestScore\)</span>.</p>

<p>The fact that <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\rho}_{STR, Testscore} = -0.2264\)</span> is cause for concern that omitting <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> leads to a negatively biased estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> since this indicates that <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Xu} &lt; 0\)</span>. As a consequence we expect <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span>, the coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(STR\)</span>, to be too large in absolute value. Put differently, the OLS estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> suggests that small classes improve test scores, but that the effect of small classes is overestimated as it captures the effect of having fewer English learners, too.</p>
<p>What happens to the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> if we add the variable <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> to the regression, that is, if we estimate the model <span class="math display">\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \beta_2 \times PctEL + u \]</span></p>
<p>instead? And what do we expect about the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span>, the estimated coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span>? Following the reasoning above we should still end up with a negative but larger coefficient estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> than before and a negative estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us estimate both regression models and compare. Performing a multiple regression in <tt>R</tt> is straightforward. One can simply add additional variables to the right hand side of the <code>formula</code> argument of the function <tt>lm()</tt> by using their names and the <tt>+</tt> operator.</p>

<p>The following section discusses some theory on multiple regression models.</p>
</div>
<div id="tmrm" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> The Multiple Regression Model</h2>
<p>The multiple regression model extends the basic concept of the simple regression model discussed in Chapters <a href="lrwor.html#lrwor">4</a> and <a href="htaciitslrm.html#htaciitslrm">5</a>. A multiple regression model enables us to estimate the effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> of changing a regressor <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i}\)</span> if the remaining regressors <span class="math inline">\(X_{2i},X_{3i}\dots,X_{ki}\)</span> <em>do not vary</em>. In fact we already have performed estimation of the multiple regression model (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.2">6.2</a>) using <tt>R</tt> in the previous section. The interpretation of the coefficient on student-teacher ratio is the effect on test scores of a one unit change student-teacher ratio if the percentage of English learners is kept constant.</p>
<p>Just like in the simple regression model, we assume the true relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i},X_{2i}\dots\dots,X_{ki}\)</span> to be linear. On average, this relation is given by the population regression function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E(Y_i\vert X_{1i}=x_1, X_{2i}=x_2,  X_{3i}=x_3,\dots, X_{ki}=x_k) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \dots + \beta_k x_k. \tag{6.3} \]</span></p>
<p>As in the simple regression model, the relation <span class="math display">\[Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki}\]</span> does not hold exactly since there are disturbing influences to the dependent variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> we cannot observe as explanatory variables. Therefore we add an error term <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> which represents deviations of the observations from the population regression line to (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.3">6.3</a>). This yields the population multiple regression model <span class="math display">\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki} + u_i, \ i=1,\dots,n. \tag{6.4} \]</span></p>
<p>Key Concept 6.2 summarizes the core concepts of the multiple regression model.</p>
<div class="keyconcept">
<h3 class="right">
Key Concept 6.2
</h3>
<h3 class="left">
The Multiple Regression Model
</h3>
<p>The multiple regression model is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki} + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n.  \]</span></p>
<p>The designations are similar to those in the simple regression model:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> observation in the dependent variable. Observations on the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> regressors are denoted by <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i},X_{2i},\dots,X_{ki}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> is the error term.</li>
<li>The average relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and the regressors is given by the population regression line <span class="math display">\[ E(Y_i\vert X_{1i}=x_1, X_{2i}=x_2,  X_{3i}=x_3,\dots, X_{ki}=x_k) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \dots + \beta_k x_k. \]</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the intercept; it is the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when all <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>s equal <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j \ , \ j=1,\dots,k\)</span> are the coefficients on <span class="math inline">\(X_j \ , \ j=1,\dots,k\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> measures the expected change in <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> that results from a one unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i}\)</span> while holding all other regressors constant.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>How can we estimate the coefficients of the multiple regression model (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.4">6.4</a>)? We will not go too much into detail on this issue as our focus is on using <tt>R</tt>. However, it should be pointed out that, similarly to the simple regression model, the coefficients of the multiple regression model can be estimated using OLS. As in the simple model, we seek to minimize the sum of squared mistakes by choosing estimates <span class="math inline">\(b_0,b_1,\dots,b_k\)</span> for the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - b_0 - b_1 X_{1i} - b_2 X_{2i} - \dots -  b_k X_{ki})^2 \tag{6.5}\]</span></p>
<p>is minimized. Note that (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.5">6.5</a>) is simply an extension of <span class="math inline">\(SSR\)</span> in the case with just one regressor and a constant. The estimators that minimize (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.5">6.5</a>) are hence denoted <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\)</span> and, as in the simple regression model, we call them the ordinary least squares estimators of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k\)</span>. For the predicted value of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> given the regressors and the estimates <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\)</span> we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{Y}_i = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 X_{1i} + \dots +\hat\beta_k X_{ki}. \]</span> The difference between <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and its predicted value <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}_i\)</span> is called the OLS residual of observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u} = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>For further information regarding the theory behind multiple regression, see Chapter 18.1 of the book which inter alia presents a derivation of the OLS estimator in the multiple regression model using matrix notation.</p>
<p>Now let us jump back to the example of test scores and class sizes. The estimated model object is <code>mult.mod</code>. As for simple regression models we can use <tt>summary()</tt> to obtain information on estimated coefficients and model statistics.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">summary</span>(mult.mod)<span class="op">$</span>coef</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##                Estimate Std. Error    t value      Pr(&gt;|t|)
## (Intercept) 686.0322445 7.41131160  92.565565 3.871327e-280
## STR          -1.1012956 0.38027827  -2.896026  3.978059e-03
## english      -0.6497768 0.03934254 -16.515882  1.657448e-47</code></pre>
<p>So the estimated multiple regression model is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \widehat{TestScore} = 686.03 - 1.10 \times STR - 0.65 \times PctEL \tag{6.6}.  \]</span></p>
<p>Unlike in the simple regression model where the data can be represented by points in the two-dimensional coordinate system, we now have three dimensions. Hence observations can be represented by points in three-dimensional space. Therefore (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.6">6.6</a>) is now longer a regression line but a <em>regression plane</em>. This idea extends to higher dimensions when we further expand the number of regressors <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. We then say that the regression model can be represented by a hyperplane in the <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> dimensional space. It is already hard to imagine such a space if <span class="math inline">\(k=3\)</span> and we best stick with the general idea that, in the multiple regression model, the dependent variable is explained by a <em>linear combination of the regressors</em>. However, in the present case we are able to visualize the situation. The following figure is an interactive 3D visualization of the data and the estimated regression plane (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.6">6.6</a>).</p>

<p>We observe that the estimated regression plane fits the data reasonably well — at least with regard to the shape and spatial position of the points. The color of the markers is an indicator for the absolute deviation from the predicted regression plane. Observations that are colored more reddish lie close to the regression plane while the color shifts to blue with growing distance. An anomaly that can be seen from the plot is that there might be heteroskedasticity: we see that the dispersion of regression errors made, i.e., the distance of observations to the regression plane tends to decrease as the share of English learning students increases.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Measures of Fit in Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>In multiple regression, common summary statistics are <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and the adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Taking the code from Section <a href="rmwmr.html#tmrm">6.2</a>, simply use <code>summary(mult.mod)</code> to obtain the <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and adjusted-<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. For multiple regression models the <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span> is computed as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ SER = s_{\hat u} = \sqrt{s_{\hat u}^2} \]</span> where modify the denominator of the premultiplied factor in <span class="math inline">\(s_{\hat u}^2\)</span> in order to accommodate for additional regressors. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ s_{\hat u}^2 = \frac{1}{n-k-1} \, SSR \]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> denoting the number of regressors <em>excluding</em> the intercept.</p>
<p>While <tt>summary()</tt> computes the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> just as in the case of a single regressor, it is no reliable measure for multiple regression models. This is due to <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> increasing whenever an additional regressor is added to the model. Adding a regressor decreases the <span class="math inline">\(SSR\)</span> — at least unless the respective estimated coefficient is exactly zero what practically never happens (see Chapter 6.4 of the book for a detailed argument). The adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> takes this into consideration by “punishing” the addition of regressors using a correction factor. So the adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, or simply <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span>, is a modified version of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. It is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \bar{R}^2 = 1-\frac{n-1}{n-k-1} \, \frac{SSR}{TSS}. \]</span></p>
<p>As you may have already suspected, <tt>summary()</tt> adjusts the formula for <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span> and it computes <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> and of course <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> by default, thereby leaving the decision which measure to rely on to the user.</p>
<p>You can find both measures at the bottom of the output produced by calling <code>summary(mult.mod)</code>.</p>

<p>Now, what can we say about the fit of our multiple regression model for test scores with the percentage of English learners as an additional regressor? Does it improve on the simple model including only an intercept and a measure of class size? The answer is yes: compare <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> with that obtained for the simple regression model <tt>mod</tt>.</p>
<p>Including <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> as a regressor improves the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span>, which we deem to be more reliable in view of the above discussion. Notice that the difference between <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> is small since <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large. In short, the fit of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.6">6.6</a>) improves vastly on the fit of the simple regression model with <span class="math inline">\(STR\)</span> as the only regressor.<br> Comparing regression errors we find that the precision of the multiple regression model (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.6">6.6</a>) improves upon the simple model as adding <span class="math inline">\(PctEL\)</span> lowers the <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(18.6\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(14.5\)</span> units of test score.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> may be used to quantify how good a model fits the data. However, it is rarely a good idea to maximize these measures by stuffing the model with regressors. You will not find any serious study that does so. Instead, it is more useful to include regressors that improve the estimation of the causal effect of interest which is <em>not</em> assessed by means the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of the model.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> OLS Assumptions in Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>In the multiple regression model we extend the three least squares assumptions of the simple regression model (see Chapter <a href="lrwor.html#lrwor">4</a>) and add a fourth assumption. These assumptions are presented in Key Concept 6.4. We will not go into the details of assumptions 1-3 since their ideas generalize easy to the case of multiple regressors. We will focus on the fourth assumption. This assumption rules out perfect correlation between regressors.</p>

<h3>Multicollinearity</h3>
<p><em>Multicollinearity</em> means that two or more regressors in a multiple regression model are <em>strongly</em> correlated. If the correlation between two or more regressors is perfect, that is, one regressor can be written as a linear combination of the other(s), we have <em>perfect multicollinearity</em>. While strong multicollinearity in general is unpleasant as it causes the variance of the OLS estimator to be large (we will discuss this in more detail later), the presence of perfect multicollinearity makes it impossible to solve for the OLS estimator, i.e., the model cannot be estimated in the first place.</p>
<p>The next section presents some examples of perfect multicollinearity and demonstrates how <tt>lm()</tt> deals with them.</p>

<p>The row <tt>FracEL</tt> in the coefficients section of the output consists of <tt>NA</tt> entries since <tt>FracEL</tt> was excluded from the model.</p>
<p>If we were to compute OLS by hand, we would run into the same problem but no one would be helping us out! The computation simply fails. Why is this? Take the following example:</p>
<p>Assume you want to estimate a simple linear regression model with a constant and a single regressor <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. As mentioned above, for perfect multicollinearity to be present <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has to be a linear combination of the other regressors. Since the only other regressor is a constant (think of the right hand side of the model equation as <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 \times 1 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is always multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for every observation), <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has to be constant as well. For <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat\beta_1 =  \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})} { \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2} = \frac{\widehat{Cov}(X,Y)}{\widehat{Var}(X)}. \tag{6.7} \]</span></p>
<p>The variance of the regressor <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is in the denominator. Since the variance of a constant is zero, we are not able to compute this fraction and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> is undefined.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this special case the denominator in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.7">6.7</a>) equals zero, too. Can you show that?</p>
<p>Let us consider two further examples where our selection of regressors induces perfect multicollinearity. First, assume that we intend to analyze the effect of class size on test score by using a dummy variable that identifies classes which are not small (<span class="math inline">\(NS\)</span>). We define that a school has the <span class="math inline">\(NS\)</span> attribute when the school’s average student-teacher ratio is at least <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NS = \begin{cases} 0, \ \ \ \text{if STR &lt; 12} \\ 1 \ \ \ \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} \]</span></p>
<p>We add the corresponding column to <tt>CASchools</tt> and estimate a multiple regression model with covariates <tt>computer</tt> and <tt>english</tt>.</p>

<p>Again, the output of <tt>summary(mult.mod)</tt> tells us that inclusion of <tt>NS</tt> in the regression would render the estimation infeasible. What happened here? This is an example where we made a logical mistake when defining the regressor <tt>NS</tt>: taking a closer look at <span class="math inline">\(NS\)</span>, the redefined measure for class size, reveals that there is not a single school with <span class="math inline">\(STR&lt;12\)</span> hence <span class="math inline">\(NS\)</span> equals one for all observations. We can check this by printing the contents of <tt>CASchools$NS</tt> or by using the function <tt>table()</tt>, see <code>?table</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">table</span>(CASchools<span class="op">$</span>NS)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
##   1 
## 420</code></pre>
<p><tt>CASchools$NS</tt> is a vector of <span class="math inline">\(420\)</span> ones and our data set includes <span class="math inline">\(420\)</span> observations. This obviously violates assumption 4 of Key Concept 6.4: the observations for the intercept are always <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>,</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  intercept = \, &amp; \lambda \cdot NS
\end{align*}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 
  \\ \vdots \\ 1
  \end{pmatrix} = \, &amp; \lambda \cdot 
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 
  \vdots \\ 1
  \end{pmatrix} \\   
  \Leftrightarrow \, &amp; \lambda = 1.
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>Since the regressors can be written as a linear combination of each other, we face perfect multicollinearity and <tt>R</tt> excludes <tt>NS</tt> from the model. Thus the take-away message is: think carefully about how the regressors in your models relate!</p>
<p>Another example of perfect multicollinearity is known as the <em>dummy variable trap</em>. This may occur when multiple dummy variables are used as regressors. A common case for this is when dummies are used to sort the data into mutually exclusive categories. For example, suppose we have spatial information that indicates whether a school is located in the North, West, South or East of the U.S. This allows us to create the dummy variables</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  North_i =&amp; 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the north} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
    West_i =&amp; 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the west} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
    South_i =&amp; 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the south} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
    East_i =&amp; 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the east} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>Since the regions are mutually exclusive, for every school <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\dots,n\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[ North_i + West_i + South_i + East_i = 1. \]</span></p>
<p>We run into problems when trying to estimate a model that includes a constant and <em>all four</em> direction dummies in the model, e.g., <span class="math display">\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \beta_2 \times english + \beta_3 \times North_i + \beta_4 \times West_i + \beta_5 \times South_i + \beta_6 \times East_i + u_i \tag{6.8}\]</span> since then for all observations <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\dots,n\)</span> the constant term is a linear combination of the dummies:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  intercept = \, &amp; \lambda_1 \cdot (North + West + South + East) \\
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{pmatrix} = \, &amp; \lambda_1 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \\   \Leftrightarrow \, &amp; \lambda_1 = 1
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>and we have perfect multicollinearity. Thus the “dummy variable trap” means not paying attention and falsely including exhaustive dummies <em>and</em> a constant in a regression model.</p>
<p>How does <tt>lm()</tt> handle a regression like (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.8">6.8</a>)? Let us first generate some artificial categorical data and append a new column named <tt>directions</tt> to <tt>CASchools</tt> and see how <tt>lm()</tt> behaves when asked to estimate the model.</p>

<p>Notice that <tt>R</tt> solves the problem on its own by generating and including the dummies <tt>directionNorth</tt>, <tt>directionSouth</tt> and <tt>directionWest</tt> but omitting <tt>directionEast</tt>. Of course, the omission of every other dummy instead would achieve the same. Another solution would be to exclude the constant and to include all dummies instead.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the information on schools located in the East is lost? Fortunately, this is not the case: exclusion of <tt>directEast</tt> just alters the interpretation of coefficient estimates on the remaining dummies from absolute to relative. For example, the coefficient estimate on <tt>directionNorth</tt> states that, on average, test scores in the North are about <span class="math inline">\(1.61\)</span> points higher than in the East.</p>
<p>A last example considers the case where a perfect linear relationship arises from redundant regressors. Suppose we have a regressor <span class="math inline">\(PctES\)</span>, the percentage of English speakers in the school where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ PctES = 100 -  PctEL\]</span></p>

<p>Once more, <tt>lm()</tt> refuses to estimate the full model using OLS and excludes <tt>PctES</tt>.</p>
<p>See Chapter 18.1 of the book for an explanation of perfect multicollinearity and its consequences to the OLS estimator in general multiple regression models using matrix notation.</p>

<div id="imperfect-multicollinearity" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Imperfect Multicollinearity</h4>
<p>As opposed to perfect multicollinearity, imperfect multicollinearity is — to a certain extent — less of a problem. In fact, imperfect multicollinearity is the reason why we are interested in estimating multiple regression models in the first place: the OLS estimator allows us to <em>isolate</em> influences of <em>correlated</em> regressors on the dependent variable. If it was not for these dependencies, there would not be a reason to resort to a multiple regression approach and we could simply work with a single-regressor model. However, this is rarely the case in applications. We already know that ignoring dependencies among regressors which influence the outcome variable has an adverse effect on estimation results.</p>
<p>So when and why is imperfect multicollinearity a problem? Suppose you have the regression model</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + u_i \tag{6.9} \]</span></p>
<p>and you are interested in estimating <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, the effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> of a one unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i}\)</span>, while holding <span class="math inline">\(X_{2i}\)</span> constant. You do not know that the true model indeed includes <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>. You follow some reasoning and add <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> as a covariate to the model in order to address a potential omitted variable bias. You are confident that <span class="math inline">\(E(u_i\vert X_{1i}, X_{2i})=0\)</span> and that there is no reason to suspect a violation of the assumptions 2 and 3 made in Key Concept 6.4. If <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> are highly correlated, OLS struggles to precisely estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. That means that although <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> is a consistent and unbiased estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, it has a large variance due to <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> being included in the model. If the errors are homoskedastic, this issue can be better understood from the formula for the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> in the model (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.9">6.9</a>) (see Appendix 6.2 of the book):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \frac{1}{1-\rho^2_{X_1,X_2}} \right) \frac{\sigma^2_u}{\sigma^2_{X_1}}. \tag{6.10} \]</span></p>
<p>First, if <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{X_1,X_2}=0\)</span>, i.e., if there is no correlation between both regressors, including <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> in the model has no influence on the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span>. Secondly, if <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> are correlated, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1}\)</span> is inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(1-\rho^2_{X_1,X_2}\)</span> so the stronger the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>, the smaller is <span class="math inline">\(1-\rho^2_{X_1,X_2}\)</span> and thus the bigger is the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span>. Thirdly, increasing the sample size helps to reduce the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span>. Of course, this is not limited to the case with two regressors: in multiple regressions, imperfect multicollinearity inflates the variance of one or more coefficient estimators. It is an empirical question which coefficient estimates are severely affected by this and which are not. When the sample size is small, one often faces the decision whether to accept the consequence of adding a large number of covariates (higher variance) or to use a model with only few regressors (possible omitted variable bias). This is called <em>bias-variance trade-off</em>.</p>
<p>In sum, undesirable consequences of imperfect multicollinearity are generally not the result of a logical error made by the researcher (as is often the case for perfect multicollinearity) but are rather a problem that is linked to the data used, the model to be estimated and the research question at hand.</p>

<h3>Simulation Study: Imperfect Multicollinearity</h3>
<p>Let us conduct a simulation study to illustrate the issues sketched above.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We use (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.8">6.9</a>) as the data generating process and choose <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 2.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2 = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> is an error term distributed as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0,5)\)</span>. In a first step, we sample the regressor data from a bivariate normal distribution: <span class="math display">\[ X_i = (X_{1i}, X_{2i}) \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N} \left[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 10 &amp; 2.5 \\ 2.5 &amp; 10 \end{pmatrix} \right] \]</span> It is straightforward to see that the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> in the population is rather low:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \rho_{X_1,X_2} = \frac{Cov(X_1,X_2)}{\sqrt{Var(X_1)}\sqrt{Var{(X_2)}}} = \frac{2.5}{10} = 0.25 \]</span></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Next, we estimate the model (<a href="#mjx-eqn-6.9">6.9</a>) and save the estimates for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>. This is repeated <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> times with a <code>for</code> loop so we end up with a large number of estimates that allow us to describe the distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We repeat steps 1 and 2 but increase the covariance between <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(2.5\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(8.5\)</span> such that the correlation between the regressors is high: <span class="math display">\[ \rho_{X_1,X_2} = \frac{Cov(X_1,X_2)}{\sqrt{Var(X_1)}\sqrt{Var{(X_2)}}} = \frac{8.5}{10} = 0.85 \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>In order to assess the effect on the precision of the estimators of increasing the collinearity between <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> we estimate the variances of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span> and compare.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> The Distribution of the OLS Estimators in Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>As in simple linear regression, different samples will produce different values of the OLS estimators in the multiple regression model. Again, this variation leads to uncertainty of those estimators which we seek to describe using their sampling distribution(s). In short, if the assumption made in Key Concept 6.4 hold, the large sample distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\)</span> is multivariate normal such that the individual estimators themselves are also normally distributed. Key Concept 6.5 summarizes the corresponding statements made in Chapter 6.6 of the book. A more technical derivation of these results can be found in Chapter 18 of the book.</p>
<div class="keyconcept">

Key Concept 6.5
</h3>
<h3 class="left">
Large-sample distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\)</span>
</h3>
<p>If the least squares assumptions in the multiple regression model (see Key Concept 6.4) hold, then, in large samples, the OLS estimators <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\)</span> are jointly normally distributed. We also say that their joint distribution is <em>multivariate</em> normal. Further, each <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_j\)</span> is distributed as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(\beta_j,\sigma_{\beta_j}^2)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Essentially, Key Concept 6.5 states that, if the sample size is large, we can approximate the individual sampling distributions of the coefficient estimators by specific normal distributions and their joint sampling distribution by a multivariate normal distribution.</p>
<p>How can we use <tt>R</tt> to get an idea of what the joint PDF of the coefficient estimators in multiple regression model looks like? When estimating a model on some data, we end up with a set of point estimates that do not reveal much information on the <em>joint</em> density of the estimators. However, with a large number of estimations using repeatedly randomly sampled data from the same population we can generate a large set of point estimates that allows us to plot an <em>estimate</em> of the joint density function.</p>
<p>The approach we will use to do this in <tt>R</tt> is a follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> random samples of size <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> using the DGP <span class="math display">\[ Y_i = 5 + 2.5 \cdot X_{1i} + 3 \cdot X_{2i} + u_i  \]</span> where the regressors <span class="math inline">\(X_{1i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{2i}\)</span> are sampled for each observation as <span class="math display">\[ X_i = (X_{1i}, X_{2i}) \sim \mathcal{N} \left[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 10 &amp; 2.5 \\ 2.5 &amp; 10 \end{pmatrix} \right] \]</span> and <span class="math display">\[ u_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,5) \]</span> is an error term.</p></li>
<li><p>For each of the <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> simulated sets of sample data, we estimate the model <span class="math display">\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + u_i \]</span> and save the coefficient estimates <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We compute a density estimate of the joint distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span> in the model above using the function <tt>kde2d()</tt> from the package <tt>MASS</tt>, see <code>?MASS</code>. This estimate is then plotted using the function <tt>persp()</tt>.</p></li>

<p>From the plot above we can see that the density estimate has some similarity to a bivariate normal distribution (see Chapter <a href="pt.html#pt">2</a>) though it is not very pretty and probably a little rough. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the estimates such that <span class="math inline">\(\rho\neq0\)</span> in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-2.1">2.1</a>). Also, the distribution’s shape deviates from the symmetric bell shape of the bivariate standard normal distribution and has an elliptical surface area instead.</p>

<pre><code>## [1] -0.2503028</code></pre>
<p>Where does this correlation come from? Notice that, due to the way we generated the data, there is correlation between the regressors <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>. Correlation between the regressors in a multiple regression model always translates into correlation between the estimators (see Appendix 6.2 of the book). In our case, the positive correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> translates to negative correlation between <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_2\)</span>. To get a better idea of the distribution you can vary the point of view in the subsequent smooth interactive 3D plot of the same density estimate used for plotting with <tt>persp()</tt>. Here you can see that the shape of the distribution is somewhat stretched due to <span class="math inline">\(\rho=-0.20\)</span> and it is also apparent that both estimators are unbiased since their joint density seems to be centered close to the true parameter vector <span class="math inline">\((\beta_1,\beta_2) = (2.5,3)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Now, let us expand the approach from the previous exercise by adding additional regressors to the model and estimating it again.</p>
<p>As has been discussed in Chapter <a href="rmwmr.html#mofimr">6.3</a>, adding regressors to the model improves the fit so the <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span> decreases and the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> increases.</p>
<p>The packages <tt>AER</tt> and <tt>MASS</tt> have been loaded. The model object <tt>bh_mod</tt> is available in the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regress the median housing value in a district, <tt>medv</tt>, on the average age of the buildings, <tt>age</tt>, the per-capita crime rate, <tt>crim</tt>, the percentage of individuals with low socioeconomic status, <tt>lstat</tt>, and a constant. Put differently, estimate the model <span class="math display">\[medv_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 lstat_i + \beta_2 age_i + \beta_3 crim_i + u_i.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Print a coefficient summary to the console that reports robust standard errors for the augmented model.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of the simple regression model is stored in <tt>R2_res</tt>. Save the multiple regression models <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> to <tt>R2_unres</tt> and check whether the augmented model yields a higher <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. Use <tt>&lt;</tt> or <tt>&gt;</tt> for the comparison.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The equation below describes estimated model from Exercise 2 (heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in parentheses).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \widehat{medv}_i = \underset{(0.74)}{32.828} \underset{(0.08)}{-0.994} \times lstat_i \underset{(0.03)}{-0.083} \times crim_i + \underset{(0.02)}{0.038} \times age_i\]</span></p>
<p>This model is saved in <tt>bh_mult_mod</tt> which is available in the working environment.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>As has been stressed in Chapter <a href="rmwmr.html#mofimr">6.3</a>, it is not meaningful to use <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> when comparing regression models with a different number of regressors. Instead, the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> should be used. <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> adjusts for the circumstance that the <span class="math inline">\(SSR\)</span> reduces when a regressor is added to the model.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the model object to compute the correction factor <span class="math inline">\(CF = \frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of observations and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of regressors, excluding the intercept. Save it to <tt>CF</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <tt>summary()</tt> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> for <tt>bh_mult_mod</tt>. It is sufficient if you print both values to the console.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that <span class="math display">\[\bar{R}^2 = 1 - (1-R^2) \cdot CF.\]</span> Use the <tt>==</tt> operator.</p></li>

<h4 id="a-fully-fledged-model-for-housing-values" class="unnumbered">4. A Fully-Fledged Model for Housing Values?</h4>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Boston.html">description</a> of the variables contained in the <tt>Boston</tt> data set. Which variable would you expect to have the highest <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value in a multiple regression model which uses <em>all</em> remaining variables as regressors to explain <tt>medv</tt>?</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regress <tt>medv</tt> on all remaining variables that you find in the Boston data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain a heteroskedasticity-robust summary of the coefficients.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> for the model in exercise 3 is <span class="math inline">\(0.5533\)</span>. What can you say about the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> of the large regression model? Does this model improve on the previous one (no code submission needed)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The packages <tt>AER</tt> and <tt>MASS</tt> as well as the data set <tt>Boston</tt> are loaded to the working environment.</p>
<iframe src="DCL/ex6_4.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:340px">
</iframe>
<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For brevity, use the regression formula <tt>medv ~.</tt> in your call of <tt>lm()</tt>. This is a shortcut that specifies a regression of <tt>medv</tt> on all the remaining variables in the data set supplied to the argument <tt>data</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <tt>summary</tt> on both models for a comparison of both <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span>s.</p></li>

<h4 id="model-selection" class="unnumbered">5. Model Selection</h4>
<p>Maybe we can improve the model by dropping a variable?</p>
<p>In this exercise, you have to estimate several models, each time dropping one of the explanatory variables used in the large regression model of Exercise 4 and compare the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The full regression model from the previous exercise, <tt>full_mod</tt>, is available in your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are completely free in solving this exercise. We recommend the following approach:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Start by estimating a model <tt>mod_new</tt>, say, where, e.g., <tt>lstat</tt> is excluded from the explanatory variables. Next, access the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> of this model.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> of this model to the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> of the full model (this was about <span class="math inline">\(0.7338\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for all explanatory variables used in the full regression model. Save the model with the highest improvement in <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^2\)</span> to <tt>better_mod</tt>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
